QUESTION 2 COMMENTARY

Unsurprisingly, as R0 increases (in our scenario, ranging from 0.5 to 10), the maximum daily prevalence and incidence rise along with it, and in the highest scenario, our disease affected nearly 100% of the population. 

The math for this mechanism is relatively simple: 

The disease is transmitted at some rate beta which forces people from susceptible into affected by the interaction of their quantities. (i.e. I increases with beta*I*S and S DECREASES in tandem). 

Additionally, people are removed from the infected pool at some rate gamma (either by recovery or death). Thus, I = beta*I*S - gamma*I.
