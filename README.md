# Answer for Question 2

## Please see Ex10_Answers.py for the code used to determine the following paragraph



### The patterns I found while answering question 2 of the exercise are determined from observing the change in S, I, and R
### depending on which beta and gamma combination being observed --- for example to compare the effect of changing B I looked at 
### numbers 3 and 4 in the chart given to us (starting with 1 not 0 in the list), and to determine the effect of gamma I
### looked at numbers 5 and 7 as gamma changed while beta stayed constant at 0.0001 --- 

### I determined that the greater the value of beta (assuming constant gamma) the faster S changed. 
### Inversely, S changed faster when gamma was .05 compared to .06.
### therefore, in terms of change in S, beta and gamma are inversely related.

### The change in I was faster when both beta and gamma are lower - therefore they are directly correlated (in a negative manner)

### the change in R was greater when both beta and gamma are higher - therefore they are directly correlated in a positive manner.

### Overall, the basic reproduction number Ro is nothing more than a ratio of beta/gamma.
