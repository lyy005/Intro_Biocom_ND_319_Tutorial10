For Q2, we came to the conclusion that, with a high beta value within 
the models provided, there is a large amount of incidence of infection, 
as well as a higher rate of infection and higher rates of, ultimately, 
resistant hosts. This makes conceptual sense since beta is used to 
determine the rates at which individuals are converted from the 
susceptible hosts pool into the infected hosts pool.
